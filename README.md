Based on the Shannon diversity analysis, the overall microbial diversity between the control and case groups
did not show a major shift, and the t-test supports that there is no strong difference in alpha diversity
between treatments. However, when looking at the NMDS ordination using Bray–Curtis distance, the
samples begin to separate more clearly in multivariate space, suggesting that even if the total diversity within
each sample is similar, the actual community structure and species composition differ. This is confirmed by
the PERMANOVA results, which indicate that treatment has a statistically significant effect on microbial
community composition. In other words, the groups may have comparable levels of diversity, but the specific
microbial profiles driving that diversity are different between cases and controls.
